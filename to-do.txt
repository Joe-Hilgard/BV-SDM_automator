Double-check accuracy of PRT matrix (e.g. are trials ending up on correct TRs?) by hand vs. by script vs by BV.
This entails generating a PRT file, letting that generate the SDMs internally in brainvoyager, then comparing the script columns.

Conduct 2x2x2+1 analysis.
I wonder if every subject has every error type in every bold? I'm gonna guess not. Fuck my life.
You can see clear example with subject 003, bold 6. No BlackGun errors (fancy that!).
Might have to return to more specific contrasts, or rearrange columns to treat irrelevant columns as confounds? I hate fMRI.

Conduct sanity check by making VOI in V1 area. VOI -> VOI options - > get timecourse for each condition. Look for clear peaks.

Does e-prime log subject response post-deadline? Yes, logs accuracy up to 800ms latency despite 500ms response deadline. Logs no response at all as 0ms incorrect response.
